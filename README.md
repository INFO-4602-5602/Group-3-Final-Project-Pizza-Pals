# Group-3-Final-Project-Pizza-Pals

ABSTRACT:

The origins of America’s favorite delivery food can be traced back to antiquity. The first known documentation of the word “pizza” was in the year 997 AD in central Italy, but archaeologists believe that Persian and Greek citizens baked flatbreads topped with cheese as early as the 6th century BC. Since it was introduced in the United States by Italian immigrants, American culinary ingenuity has greatly influenced the many styles and flavors of pizza. To further explore this American cultural and culinary staple, the use of visualizations presents an interesting and creative opportunity to convey statistical information. Using visualizations to show data clearly and concisely led to the affirmation of some widely held pizza preconceptions such as America’s favorite toppings, but also helped to unveil some unexpected information such as regional costs.
